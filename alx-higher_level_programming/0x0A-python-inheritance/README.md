Learning Objectives
-------------------

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/ "explain to anyone"), **without the help of Google**:

### General

-   Why Python programming is awesome
-   What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
-   What is a subclass
-   How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
-   When can an instance have new attributes
-   How to inherit class from another
-   How to define a class with multiple base classes
-   What is the default class every class inherit from
-   How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
-   Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
-   What is the purpose of inheritance
-   What are, when and how to use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type` and `super` built-in functions

Requirements
------------

### Python Scripts

-   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
-   All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
-   A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-   Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
-   All your files must be executable
-   The length of your files will be tested using `wc`


### Python Test Cases

-   Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
-   All your files should end with a new line
-   All your test files should be inside a folder tests
-   All your test files should be text files (extension: .txt)
-   All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
-   All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
-   All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
-   All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
-   A documentation is not a simple word, it's a real sentence explaining what's the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
-   We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case


### Documentation

-   Do not use the words `import` or `from` inside your comments, the checker will think you try to import some modules
